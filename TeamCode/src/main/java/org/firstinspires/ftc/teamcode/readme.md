# TeamCode Module

This is where we put our OpModes.
### IMPORTANT:
#### SCROLL DOWN FOR NAMING CONVENTIONS. READ THEM AND FOLLOW THEM.

## Creating your own OpModes

There are a few ways you can do this:
#### 1. Copy and customize a sample OpMode: 

Sample opmodes exist in the FtcRobotController module. Open the module, then go to 
`java -> org.firstinspires.ftc.robotcontroller -> external -> samples`
(Expand the tree elements by clicking the little triangle next to them.)

Once you are there, just copy the class you want in there into the TeamCode module, rename it,
and modify it.

#### 2. Create an OpMode yourself

Each TeleOp OpMode must start with 2 lines of code like these:
```
 @TeleOp(name="Name of the TeleOp", group="TeleOps")
 @Disabled
```
And Autonomous OpModes start with these 2 lines:
```
 @Autonomous(name="Name of the Autonomous", group="AutoOps")
 @Disabled
```

We need to **register** our OpModes so that the driver station can see them. These annotations allow
us to do that. That `name="Name of the OpMode"` atribute gives the OpMode a name, and
that `group="OpModes"`tag puts it in a group. Not every OpMode needs to be in a group - you'll 
have to decide if it should be in one or not. `@Disabled` disables the OpMode - comment tha out to
enable it.

To register an OpMode for use, you need to register it in the `FtcOpModeRegister` class. There's a
comment in there that describes how to do that.

## Naming conventions
**Names are important. Without proper naming conventions, it is very hard to be organized.
Names must be concise, descriptive, and apply to our rules. If they aren't any of those, they will be changed.**
#### Classes
* Every word starts our with a capital letter, and there are no spaces. `AutoButtonPusher` is a good
name, but `Autobuttonpusher` or `Auto Button Pusher` are bad names.
* Name them concisely and descriptively. `TeleOpThatDoesStuff` is not descriptive. But don't be too long - names over
20 characters long will throw an error.
* All classes should be of the form "SpecificName" + "GeneralName", for example "ButtonPusherTeleOp".
* Proof of Concept OpModes should have names that end in `PoC`.
* TeleOp OpModes should have names that start with `TeleOp`.
* Autonomous OpModes should have names that start with `Auto`.

#### Variables
* Variables **never** start with a capital letter.
* Variables names should be seperated_by_underscores. Hardware devices (such as sensors) should be in camelCase.
* Booleans (true/false variables) should be phrased like statements: `weAreRed` and `opModeIsActive` are
good examples.
* Name them concisely and descriptively. `gamepadLeftJoystickForwardBackwardPower` is waaaaay too long.
`movementPower` is too vague. `leftDrivePower` is good.
